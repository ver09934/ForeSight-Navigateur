if (within 10 meters of polyline)
	direct user parallel to polyline
else // greater than 10 meters from polyline
	Direct user perpendicular to the polyline (get them back on the route)
	// Options: guide user directly perpendicular, or guide them 30 degrees from the normal

// Only call when (navigationIsActive)

	Location location2
