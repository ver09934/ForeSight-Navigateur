if (within 10 meters of polyline)
	direct user parallel to polyline
else // greater than 10 meters from polyline
	Direct user perpendicular to the polyline (get them back on the route)
	// Options: guide user directly perpendicular, or guide them 30 degrees from the normal

// Only call when (navigationIsActive)
public double getDistanceToCurrentRoute() {
	Location location2
	//
	return currentLocation.getDistance(Location2);
}

Additions:
Anticipating a turn to alert the user:

if the next waypoint is a turn waypoint, then alert the user of a turn
a waypoint is a turn waypoint if the smaller of the two angles formed by it, the previous, and the next waypoint is less than a set value, such as 120 degrees or 90 degrees
